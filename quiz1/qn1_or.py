'''Suppose you have a function F such that given two lists L1 and L2, f(L1, L2) returns the
difference of the sum of the elements of L1 and L2. Now given a list of size n that consists
of n âˆ’ 1 many 1s and a single 2, find the position of 2 making at most 2 log n many calls
to the function F.
For example, if the list is [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], the index is 3 where 2 occurs.
