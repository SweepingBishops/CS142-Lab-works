Arrays:
    - Random accesss: any arbitraty element can be accessed 
    - Static: size must be specified at inititialisation (but dynamic arrays exist)
    - Ineffecient memory allocation.
    - Inserting and deleteing elements in dynamic arrays are expensive (when changing the first elements).

Linked list:
    - Sequential access (access time will be Î˜(i)).
    - Efficient memory allocation.
    - Dynamic (mostly).
    - Inserting and deleting elements are expensive (when chaging the last elements).
